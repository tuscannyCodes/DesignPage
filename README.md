# Design Work

This is a compilation of my favorite Web Design pieces. Most of these were designed using Figma, while some were first sketched using pen and paper or sketched in Adobe Photoshop. Some of these mockups were eventually developed with code into actual web pages, while some remain as simple designs for future projects or templates. I really enjoy design and creating mockups in this style is an essential part of my web development process when building websites from scratch.
